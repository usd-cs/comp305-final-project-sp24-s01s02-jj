# Your Design

---
- What classes do I need? Would it be helpful to have any interfaces or abstract classes and for what?
    - TODO: fill in your classes, interfaces, abstract classes
---

## For each Interface

- What are the promised actions (methods) of anything that implements this interface?
- What are the parameters needed?
- What will they return?

    - Fill in the above questions for each interface

---

## For each Abstract class

- Does this class need to implement any interfaces or extend any classes? Any you wrote or others.
- What is the information (instance variables) that this class has that will be similar across child classes?
- What are the types, should they have any default values?
- What are the promised actions (methods) for this class?
- What are the parameters needed?
- What will they return?
- Which of these should be concrete and which abstract?

    - Fill in the above questions for each interface

## For each class

- What is the information (instance variables) that this class has?
- What are the types?
- What are the actions (methods) for this class? Which of these methods do other classes need access to?
- What are the parameters needed?
- What will they return?

    - Fill in the above questions for each interface

## Testing for each method


- What are your test cases that you need and what inputs and outputs will you test for each?

    - TODO: fill in your testing plan
